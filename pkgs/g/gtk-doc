[Description]
The GTK-Doc package contains a code documenter. This is useful for extracting
specially formatted comments from the code to create API documentation. This
package is optional; if it is not installed, packages will not build the
documentation. This does not mean that you will not have any documentation. If
GTK-Doc is not available, the install process will copy any pre-built
documentation to your system. 

[Install]
cd */
autoreconf -fiv           &&
./configure --prefix=/usr &&
make                      &&
make install || exit 1
