[Description]
The GNU Hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting. Yes, this is
another implementation of the classic program that prints “Hello, world!” when
you run it.

However, unlike the minimal version often seen, GNU Hello processes its
argument list to modify its behavior, supports greetings in many languages,
and so on. The primary purpose of GNU Hello is to demonstrate how to write
other programs that do these things; it serves as a model for GNU coding
standards and GNU maintainer practices.

GNU Hello is written in C. For implementations in other programming languages,
notably including translation into other languages, please see the GNU Gettext
distribution.
