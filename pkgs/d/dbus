[Description]
D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one
another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate
process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance"
application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when
their services are needed.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device
added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for
general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on
top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any
two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus
daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, or
through unencrypted TCP/IP suitable for use behind a firewall with shared NFS
home directories. (Help wanted with better remote transports - the transport
mechanism is well-abstracted and extensible.)
