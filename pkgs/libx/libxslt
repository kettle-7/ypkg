[Description]
Libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project. XSLT itself is
an XML language to define transformation for XML. Libxslt is based on libxml2
the XML C library developed for the GNOME project. It also implements most of
the EXSLT set of processor-portable extensions functions and some of Saxon's
evaluate and expressions extensions.

People can either embed the library in their application or use xsltproc the
command line processing tool. This library is free software and can be reused
in commercial applications.
